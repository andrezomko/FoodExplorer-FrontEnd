The program has two personas, the admin and the users.

The admin is the person responsible for the restaurant and can create, view, edit, and delete a dish at any time. Each dishes includes an image, a name, a category, a brief description, the ingredients, and its price. When the admin clicks on "add dish", they will receive a success message and be redirected to the main page.

The user will be able to view all registered dishes, and when they click on a dish, they will be redirected to a new page with more detailed information about it.
